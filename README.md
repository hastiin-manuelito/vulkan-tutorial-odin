### Set up environment

If you like using an IDE please go here: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment to set it up.

It is recommended to use the LunarG SDK, available here: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/

In Odin we only need to import the vulkan libraries (it pretty much just works), they must be installed of course (see above). For this tutorial we don't need to worry about linking any libraries.

We will be using glfw3, available in the vendor libraries.

### Initialize glfw
